              <h2 id="Overview">Overview</h2>
              <p>Sugar offers users a wide range of configuration options when getting started with the application. Your first time logging into Sugar the New User Wizard will step through configuring some basic settings (i.e. Your Information, Your Locale, etc.). You may skip these steps and configure these settings in your user preferences at a later time. Please note that system administrators can also set up each user's basic settings when creating the user in Sugar. This documentation will cover the various options (e.g. New User Wizard, User Preferences, etc.) available when first getting started with Sugar and accessing your account.</p>
              <h2 id="Accessing_Sugar">Accessing Sugar</h2>
              <h3 id="Prerequisites">Prerequisites</h3>
              <p>The following will need to be installed and configured on your local machine prior to accessing Sugar:</p>
              <ul><li>A supported web browser application (e.g. Chrome, Firefox, etc.) is required on your local machine. For more information on the various supported web browsers, please refer to the <a href="/Resources/Supported_Platforms/">Supported Platforms</a> page.</li>
              <li>The web browser must have JavaScript and cookie support enabled in order to access Sugar.</li>
              <li>Network access to a server running your Sugar instance is required.</li>
              </ul><h3 id="Logging_In">Logging In</h3>
              <p>The Sugar login screen allows you to enter login credentials (user name and password) to access your instance. Navigate your web browser to your instance's URL (e.g. <span class="plain">https://example.sugarondemand.com</span>) to access Sugar's login screen. If you do not know your instance URL or login credentials, please reach out to your system administrator for assistance. The New User Wizard will launch upon your first successful log in to Sugar allowing you to configure some of your basic personal settings. <br><img src="/files/29879d61-68f9-74e6-ce52-5503042ca770.png" border="0" alt=""></p>
              <h3 id="Resetting_Your_Password">Resetting Your Password</h3>
              <p>There may be occasions when users forget their Sugar password and will need to reset it. If the system administrator has enabled the Forgot Password feature via Admin &gt; Password Management, user's will have the option to request a password reset directly from Sugar's login screen. If you do not see the Forgot Password link on your login screen, please reach out to your system administrator for further assistance. System administrators can either enable the Forgot Password feature, send a system-generated password to the user, or manually change the user's password via Admin &gt; User Management. For more information on how to set up and manage passwords in Sugar, please refer to the <a href="../../Administration_Guide/Password_Management">Password Management</a> documentation. Please note that the outbound mail server for the system must be configured via Admin &gt; Email Settings and users will also need to have their <a href="#Email_Settings">personal email settings</a> configured in their user preferences in order for the temporary password information to be emailed.For more information on setting up the system email settings, please refer to the <a href="../../Administration_Guide/Email#Email_Settings">Email</a> documentation in the Administration guide.</p>
              <p>Use the following steps to request a new password:</p>
              <ol><li>Click the Forgot Password? link on the bottom left of Sugar's login dialog box. <br><img src="/files/82f53486-9b96-6af5-cb43-550304056509.png" border="0" alt=""></li>
              <li>Enter your Sugar username and primary email address on file, then click "Request Password". If submitted successfully, a message will appear that your request has been submitted. <br><img src="/files/b551f2fa-a0f2-a0f5-4b0f-5503049addb2.png" border="0" alt="" width="258px"></li>
              <li>A temporary password will be emailed to your primary email address.</li>
              <li>Enter the temporary password into Sugar's log in screen. <br><strong>Note</strong>: Be sure to change your password once logged in by navigating to the <a href="#Password_Tab">Password tab</a> in your user preferences.</li>
              </ol><h3 id="Setting_Your_Language">Setting Your Language</h3>
              <p>User's have the option to choose the primary language they want displayed in Sugar by clicking the Language icon on the bottom right of the Login screen. The Language dropdown list will appear allowing you to select the appropriate language you want displayed in your Sugar account. The out-of-the-box default language is English (US), but administrators can change the default language globally via Admin &gt; Locale. For more information on configuring the default language in Sugar, please refer to the <a href="../../Administration_Guide/System#User_Interface_2">User Interface</a> section of the System documentation. Once the default language is changed by the administrator, it will display as the default selection on the login screen for all users.</p>
              <p>Administrators can also control what languages are available to select in the Language dropdown list via Admin &gt; Languages. If you do not see one of the listed languages below displayed in the Language dropdown list, please reach out to your system administrator for assistance. For more information on managing languages in Sugar, please refer to the <a href="../../Administration_Guide/System#Languages">Languages</a> section of the System documentation.<br><img src="/files/c77481a1-49fa-f048-1867-55030567a5a8.png" border="0" alt="" width="194"></p>

              </table><h3 id="Logging_Out">Logging Out</h3>
              <p>When you are done working in Sugar and wish to log out of the system, simply click your user name on the upper right of Sugar and select "Log Out". This will log you out completely from Sugar and you must <a href="#Logging_In">log in</a> again in order to access your account.<br><img src="/files/5091d1f2-48a5-3323-6fb0-550304ecb435.png" border="0" alt=""></p>
              <h4 id="Automatic_Log_Outs">Automatic Log Outs</h4>
              <p>While working in Sugar, a user may be automatically logged out of the system. Currently, Sugar allows a username to be logged in under only one session, and any additional user sessions started using the same username will log out the previous session. This behavior is for your security as Sugar does not allow multiple sessions for the same username from different machines or browsers. To prevent situations like this, please do not share your login credentials (username and password) with users in your organization.</p>
              <p>Another situation where users are automatically logged out is when the user does not perform any actions in Sugar for a certain period of time. The security timeout period in Sugar is controlled by configuration settings in PHP and the web server running your Sugar instance. Please note that the PHP session's lifetime persists until you close your web browser and the default session timeout value is 1440 seconds (24 minutes).</p>
              <p>In order to prevent security timeouts, users can navigate or click the page(s) in Sugar every so often to keep the session active. If the session times out, click any button, tab, etc. on the current page once you are ready to continue working in Sugar, and you will be taken back to the <a href="#Logging_In">Login screen</a>. Another option is to completely close your current browser and open a new browser to navigate back to Sugar's Login page.</p>
              <p>Please note that users can have multiple tabs of Sugar pages open within the same web browser (e.g. Chrome) without getting logged out of the system. For example, this is useful when working with multiple Sugar pages or records without navigating away from previous pages.</p>
              <h2 id="New_User_Wizard">New User Wizard</h2>
              <p>When users first log in to Sugar, they will step through the New User Wizard to configure some basic settings (i.e. Your Information, Your Locale, etc.). If the system administrator already configured your basic settings when adding you as a user to Sugar, the fields in the wizard will be populated with the provided information. You can update your information as you go through the New User Wizard to make any necessary changes. Please note that you can skip the steps in the wizard if you wish to configure the settings via your user preferences at a later time.</p>
              <h3 id="Configuring_Your_Information">Configuring Your Information</h3>
              <p>The Your Information step of the New User Wizard allows you to enter basic information (e.g. name, email address, phone) about yourself to be stored in your user profile. Please note that the information provided on this step can be updated in your user preferences at a later time if desired. For more information on configuring your personal information, please refer to the <a href="#User_Preferences">User Preferences</a> section of this documentation.</p>
              <p>The following options are available to configure your user profile:</p>
              <ul><li><strong>First Name</strong> : Enter your first name.</li>
              <li><strong>Last Name </strong>: Enter your last name.</li>
              <li><strong>Email</strong> : Enter your primary email address.</li>
              <li><strong>Phone</strong> : Enter your office number.</li>
              </ul><p>Please note that all required fields will indicate "Required" in the field and must be completed prior to moving to the next step of the wizard. Once your personal information is entered, click "Next". <br><img src="/files/2180fe54-b994-e6ad-d1ab-55030470390f.png" border="0" alt="" width="517px"></p>
              <h3 id="Configuring_Your_Locale">Configuring Your Locale</h3>
              <p>The User Locale Settings step allows you to configure the date, time, and name format you want displayed in Sugar based on your current geographical location. Please note that the information provided on this page can be updated in your <a href="#User_Preferences">user preferences</a> at a later time if desired.</p>
              <p>The following options are available to configure your locale settings:</p>
              <ul><li><strong>Time Zone</strong> : Select the time zone based on your current geographical location.</li>
              <li><strong>Date Format</strong> : Select the format you want the date stamps displayed in Sugar.</li>
              <li><strong>Time Format</strong> : Select the format you want the time stamps displayed in Sugar.</li>
              <li><strong>Name Format </strong>: Select the format you want the concatenated name fields displayed in Sugar's list view and record view.</li>
              </ul><p>Once your locale information is entered, click "Next". <br><img src="/files/422ee1e1-e969-905e-7adc-550304ae6cdc.png" border="0" alt=""></p>
              <p>The following page will confirm that your set up is complete and that you are ready to use Sugar. You can access the various support resources (e.g. Documentation, Knowledge Base, etc.) available by clicking one of the boxes in the dialog box. Please note that you can click "Start Sugar" to go directly into your Sugar account. <br><img src="/files/993e12b0-187d-39b6-cdc1-550304994e3d.png" border="0" alt=""></p>

You can use this option to change temporary Sugar password's, system-generated password's for password resets, etc. Administrators also have the ability to change or reset a user's password via Admin &gt; User Management. For more information on how administrator's can reset a user's password, please refer to the&nbsp;<a href="../../Administration_Guide/Users#Resetting_User_Passwords">Resetting User Passwords</a> section of the User Management documentation. Please note that passwords can be changed as often as you wish in Sugar. Updating password's in Sugar on a regular basis is recommended for the security of your account.</p>
              <p>To reset your password, enter your current password, new password, and confirmed password making sure to meet the password requirements listed on the right. Each password requirement will be checked off in the list as the new password meets the required conditions. Please note that the new password you enter must meet all the restrictions in order for the password to save. System administrators can configure the password requirements via Admin &gt; Password Management. They can choose the minimum and maximum lengths required for the password, as well as indicate if any special characters are needed. Additional requirements such as upper case, lower case letters, and numbers can also be part of the set restriction. The password requirement set by the system administrator determines what users will need to include when creating new passwords. Although not recommended, administrators can choose to not set password requirements if they wish, which will allow users to change their passwords without any restrictions. For more information on configuring password requirements, please refer to the <a href="../../Administration_Guide/Password_Management#Password_Requirements">Password Requirements</a> section of the Password Management documentation. Once you have entered the new password, click "Save" to preserve the change. <br><img src="/files/f0312d99-da83-5ac3-4e2d-5503047aa018.png" border="0" alt="" width="575px"></p>

              <h3 id="Access_Tab">Access Tab</h3>
              <p>Users can view their access information (e.g. Access table, Roles, My Teams) via the Access tab in the detail view of their profile. System administrators can assign users to various teams and roles depending on what each user is allowed access to in Sugar. You will be able to view the team(s) and role(s) assigned to you via the Roles and My Teams section in the Access tab.</p>
              <h4 id="Access_Table">Access Table</h4>
              <p>The Access table summarizes the set of permissions assigned to the user and allows them to view the type of access they have along with the actions (e.g. View, Edit, Delete, etc.) they can perform in Sugar. Only system administrators have the ability to create roles and assign them to users. Users who are assigned to the role will only be able to perform actions defined by it. Please note that users with more than one role assigned will have the more restrictive role setting prevail on the access table. For example, if one role allows the user to delete records in the Contacts module, but the other role does not allow record deletion, the user will not be able to delete records in the Contacts module. The table will list the modules in rows on the far left with column headers representing the type of action (e.g. Delete, Edit, Export, etc.) users can perform in each module. For more information on the Access table column headers, please refer to the&nbsp;<a href="../../Administration_Guide/Role_Management#Setting_Module-Level_Permissions">Setting Module-Level Permissions</a> section in the Role Management documentation.</p>

              <h4 id="Roles">Roles</h4>
              <p>Sugar Roles define permissions for users such as what kinds of records they can access and what level of access they are allowed . Roles work in conjunction withteams to form a robust security model for non-admin users in Sugar. Roles control three different layers of access for users within Sugar: module, field, and action-level access. Please note that only users who are assigned to the specific role will be able to perform actions (e.g. view, edit, delete, etc.) defined by it. For more information on the various actions and setting options for roles, please refer to the <a href="#Access_Table">Access Table</a> section of this documentation. Users who arenot assigned to a role can access and perform actions in any module as long as they are assigned to the record or a member of the team assigned to manage it. System administrators have the ability to create various roles and assign additional roles to users via Admin &gt; Role Management. For more information on creating and assigning roles, please refer to the <a href="../../Administration_Guide/Role_Management">Role Management</a> documentation.</p>
              <p>The Roles section displays the list of roles (if any) assigned to the user. Please note that if you are assigned to more than one role, the more restrictive role setting prevails. For example, if you have two roles where one role allows exporting of records in the Leads module and the other does not, then you will not be able to export lead records due to the more restrictive role setting.<img src="/files/bdcade4f-f1b4-2ae8-d429-550304e36ca4.png" border="0" alt=""></p>
              <h4 id="My_Teams">My Teams</h4>
              <p>Teams consist of one or more users who are assigned to manage records in Sugar. The defined permissions determine what records a user is and is not able to access. Teams are used in conjunction withroles to form a robust security model for non-admin users in Sugar. The My Teams section displays the list of teams a user is associated with, which determines what records the user has access to in Sugar. Please note that every record is assigned to at least one team, but can be assigned to multiple teams as well if different users need access to it. The default team(s) set in the User Settings section under the Advanced tabwill automatically be assigned to new records created by the user. Users assigned to the record, as well as system administrators can access the record regardless of team membership. When a user is created in Sugar, they are automatically associated to the Global team (universal team) and a Private team (users own personal team) is created by default. System administrators can assign users to additional teams via Admin &gt; User Management or Admin &gt; Team Management as necessary. For more information on teams as well as creating and assigning teams, please refer to the <a href="../../Administration_Guide/Team_Management">Team Management</a> documentation.<img src="/files/5db8a542-71e2-2c68-190b-550304804a62.png" border="0" alt="" width="282px"></p>
